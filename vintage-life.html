                The web responsive version has an additional launch page that

          <p>
            No BS. Vintage Life may be online but it should feel accessible and
            laidback like your local vintage clothing store ! Still, what you
            see is what you get, just because we are casual does not mean we are
            not transparent.

          <p>
            To create my user flow diagram I chose to focus on the following
            user stories:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              As a new customer, I want to access the inventory without having
              to register, so that I can make sure this store has what I’m
              looking for before having to create an account
            </li>
            <li>
              As a customer, I want to be able to place multiple items in a
              shopping cart, so that I can purchase more than one item at a time
            </li>
            <li>
              As a returning customer, I want to see an overview of my previous
              activity, so that I can view previous purchases and search history
            </li>
            <li>
              As a returning customer, I want to be able to save items that I
              cannot buy to a wish list, so that I can purchase them at a later
              date
            </li>
            <li>
              As a customer, I want there to be a variety of payment options, so
              that I can choose the payment method that suits me best
            </li>
            <li>
              As a customer, I want to be able to see when stock is on sale, so
              that I can save money
            </li>
            <li>
              As a customer, I want to have access to advanced filtering
              options, so that I don’t have to browse through a lot of products
              to find what I’m looking for
            </li>
            <li>
              As a frequent customer, I want to see recommendations of products
              I may like, so that I find items I might not otherwise on my own
            </li>

                The brand color is a cobalt green. Green is universally linked
                with nature, representing growth and renewal which are all
                relevant associations for second hand shopping (i.e. more
                sustainable e-commerce). The cool cobalt saturation is both
                soothing and peaceful.

                Black and white are the other two dominant colors. The secondary
                green is a lighter shade of the primary one keeping the palette
                limited to three colors (considering the secondary grey as an
                intermediary color). The result is a very clean and bright

                conveying transparency and trustworthiness.

              <h2>Logo</h2>
              <p>
                The logo is the intersection of the first two letters of Vintage
                Life. The design is inspired by the Bauhaus approach to design
                where forms of expression are derived from function and dispense
                of the superfluous.
              </p>
              <p>
                The flat and minimalist design evokes simplicity and a certain
                timelessness. The latter association is particularly coherent
                for vintage clothing that can find new life beyond the
                restrictive considerations of fast fashion.
              </p>
              <p>
                The logotype was created with the Futura-Bold font. The “L” in
                “Life” has been slightly modified at the base to suggest a
                continuous line with the “V” of Vintage” that runs parallel to
                the right hand side of the logo.
              </p>
              <p>
                The colors used are the same three primary ones used for the
                app.
              </p>
              <p>
                The logo can be used on its own when space is limited. The
                logotype should always be used with the logo and on the right as
                shown.

            <p>
              The primary aim with the typography is to reinforce the functional
              and minimalist design.
            </p>
            <p>
              Futura-Bold font makes for clean-looking headlines and text that
              is easy to read. Designed by Paul Renner and released in 1927, it
              was inspired by the concepts of Bauhaus.
            </p>
            <p>
              Designed by the Dutch software developer Ralph Levien, Inconsolata
              has clean lines that make it highly readable.

          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>What went well?</h3>
            <p>
              Building a cohesive brand from the start really helped to keep the
              design process all the way from low fidelity wireframes to the
              final mockups rather smooth.
            </p>
            <p>
              Having a clear intent and a full picture of where the design
              should go helped each step iterate over the previous one with very
              little redesign or back and forth.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>What were the challenges?</h3>
            <p>
              Lack of focus was at times distracting. While waiting for
              additional feedback after my usability test I decided to start
              working on a web responsive version fo the app. Although not a
              part of the originally intended deliverables.
            </p>
            <p>
              I originally thought it would not take too much time and would be
              a nice addition to the mobile version. The problem was that by the
              time I got my feedback I was not quite finished and now had some
              additional screens to work on.
            </p>
            <p>
              Thankfully the screens did not take much more time and the end
              result was quite satisfying. However adding on more work when
              there was no need was an easily avoidable issue.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>What could be improved?</h3>
            <p>
              Pictures were primarily sourced from free of use Pexel stock
              photos and were supplemented by some of my own. As a result the
              visual language is perhaps not as coherent as it could be,
              particularly in terms of pictures of clothing items. In my opinion
              not using any models is the most pragmatic for a vintage store
              (easy to implement and keeps costs down).
            </p>
            <p>
              Future iterations could be more cohesive in terms of background,
              lighting, etc.
